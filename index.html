		<h1>Standard response to standard recruitment email</h1>
		<h3>Ever read this phrase: <i>"I saw your profile and you look perfect for the role of: <u>Something you are not</u>"</i>? Is the email the most standard thing ever? Send them one back!</h3>
		<p>Let's face it, something is either wrong with them or your profile. Ask them what made them think you were right for something completly wrong. Use this email template, fields in red underline can be edited.</p>

				<h3>Hi,</h3>
				<p>I would like to know what on my profile you think would fit in the role of "<span contenteditable="true" class="editable_field">Something you are not</span>"? I need you to clarify what you are looking for. </p>
				<p>With regards,</p>
