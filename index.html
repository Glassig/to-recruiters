		<h1>Standard response to standard recruitment email</h1>
		<h3>Ever read this phrase: <i>"I saw your profile and you look perfect for the role of: <u>Completly off role</u>"</i>? Is the email the most standard thing ever? Send them one back!</h3>
		<p>Let's face it, something is either wrong with them or your profile. Ask them what made them think you were right for something completly wrong. Use this email template.</p>
		<div id="email">
			<h3>Hi,</h3>
			<p>I would like to know what on my profile you think would fit in the role of "<span contenteditable="true" class="editable_field">a passionate C # developer who has previous experience with CQRS, DDD and Event Sourcing</span>"? I need you to clarify what you are looking for. </p>
